## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Development Strategy

For this project, I wrote most of your code in js/app.js. The project was broken down into small pieces of work for better understanding. With these bite-sized amounts, it was be easier to debug and fix any issues that appear.

## Development Strategy Steps

 - Start by linking js/app.js
 - Build HTML and at least 3 content sections.
 - Build the navigation menu dynamically.
 - Add functionality to distinguish the section in view.
 - Add the functionality to scroll to sections.
 - REFACTOR.
 - Test the performance.

## Tools

- Visual Studio Code.
- Chrome Developer Tool.
